# Notice! Do not place your custom translation files here.

Legenda will look in this directory for translations as a fallback. It is however recommended that you use the global WordPress language directory and install your translations like so: `/wp-content/languages/themes/legenda-es_ES.mo`. That way they will not be lost or overwritten during Legenda updates.
